# Investment-Risk-Analysis
This project analyzes investment risks across sectors like Marketing, R&amp;D, IT, Construction, Manufacturing, and Healthcare. Using data from Excel, SQL for querying, and Matplotlib for visualization, it evaluates risk factors such as volatility and return variance to support informed investment decisions.

# Why am I building this dashboard?
Today, I’d like to talk about investment risk analysis and introduce a project that explores how different sectors are affected by various risk factors. Whether you're a financial analyst, a business strategist, or a data enthusiast, understanding how investment risk varies across industries is crucial in making sound financial decisions.

To begin with, let's quickly define investment risk: it’s the probability or likelihood of losses relative to the expected return on any particular investment. Every investment—whether it’s in infrastructure, R&D, or technology—carries a certain level of risk. What’s important is identifying, measuring, and managing these risks so that investors can make informed choices.

Now, let’s consider a key point: not all sectors carry the same risk profile. For instance, a tech startup investing heavily in R&D might face higher volatility compared to a well-established manufacturing firm. Similarly, the healthcare industry is subject to regulatory risks and public policy changes, whereas construction projects are highly sensitive to supply chain disruptions and raw material costs.

In this project, I’ve conducted a comparative investment risk analysis across six major sectors: Marketing, R&D, IT, Construction, Manufacturing, and Healthcare. Using real-world data compiled in an Excel spreadsheet, I used SQL for data extraction and organization, and Matplotlib for visualizing key patterns and insights.

The analysis is built around several core factors:

Volatility and Return Variance – How consistent or inconsistent are the returns over time?

Capital Intensity – How much upfront investment is required, and what’s the payback timeline?

Operational Dependencies – For instance, does a sector rely heavily on third-party vendors or overseas suppliers?

Geographical Exposure – Are investments localized or spread globally? A political event or natural disaster in one region can drastically impact certain sectors.

Team Experience Level- Are the professionals working on the project experienced enough to pull off the project in time

Technological Risk – Especially relevant to IT and R&D, where rapid innovation can make products or services obsolete quickly.

Let me give a few brief examples to highlight this:

R&D investments are highly speculative. They may not generate immediate returns and are subject to high failure rates. Their risk is elevated by factors like technological disruption and uncertain market demand.

Construction projects, on the other hand, are heavily influenced by location-specific factors such as land availability, weather, local regulations, and even labor laws. A construction project in one region may carry a completely different risk profile than the same project elsewhere.

Healthcare investments are affected by public policy, aging populations, and patent laws. A change in government regulation can quickly shift the risk dynamics in this sector.

By using data analytics, we’ve visualized and compared risk metrics across these sectors, allowing stakeholders to better understand where and why risk occurs—and how to mitigate it. This makes the project not just a theoretical exercise, but a practical tool for guiding real-world investment decisions.

In conclusion, investment risk analysis is not one-size-fits-all. It requires contextual understanding of external dependencies, geographical exposure, and industry-specific challenges. Through this project, we aim to present a data-driven approach to identifying those risks, ultimately helping investors and businesses make more resilient financial plans.

Now we do have to relate that how these KPI's in turn are related in making the sector riskier
For instance if the project is getting delayed by a significant time then it indicates a potential risk on the other hand if the project manager experience is more it leads to the project becoming less riskier

Now upon comparing all these factors and supposing that we give an equal weightage to every factor that we have considered let us find out which sector is the most riskiest to invest in

Now that we have found out which one is the riskiest let us find out how does the type of funding impacts these sectors
